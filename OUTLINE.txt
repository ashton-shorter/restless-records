What is the main goal of this site?
    Promote locals through an upwork/soundcloud hybrid with unique design
    Very musician oriented. Most of the content will be songs to listen&like
    This is an advertisement hub for
        Performers,
        Vendors,
        Artists,
        Venues,
        Events
    Event Hosts will come here to hand pick their staff
        This includes
            Staff - each will have a record of shows worked
                Bartenders,
                Security,
                Stagehands
            Equipment Rental
                This will have to include scheduling, and payment services
                In the beginning can be by inquiry

    So this is a site where artists can display their work to potentially land a gig
    Venues advertise their events
    A place where local staff can be hired
    Equipment can be rented

    *All businesses and events should have designated database space to load media
    *A good idea is to implement a messaging service as to keep communications and engagement within the site
    *This should also be an all-in-one platform where you can buy preloaded/gift cards to attend events now or in the future
    *Hiring talent/staff searches by zip code 

So there are two business categories
    Talent:
        Musicians,
        Performers,
        Vendors,
        Live Artists
    Staff:
        Bartenders,
        Security,
        Stagehands
Pages:
    Talent
    Staff
    Events&Venues(Won't always be at a venue)
        venues can list a rental price as well
    Equipment Rental
    Profile
    Blog
    Merch

For Event hosts, to contact talent/staff/venues/equipment renters
    talk through the messaging system
    and/or they can post an event that is looking for x and y
        users should be able to filter by events that are looking to hire

The messaging system could get annoying if popular artists are bothered by non talent buyers a lot
    one fix is the ability to filter their messages from talent buyers only
        this won't eliminate fake talent buyers
        but you can by adding additional filtering based upon the talent buyer rep

    I really like the messaging system for general users to talk with each other about events and whatnot.
